					<p>Baker was born in Scotland Road, Liverpool, England. His mother, Mary Jane (n√©e Fleming), was a cleaner, and his father, John Stewart Baker was a Jewish[2] English sailor who was rarely at home. His parents were working class Liverpudlians. Baker left school at 15 to become a Roman Catholic monk and remained in this lifestyle for six years, but left after losing his faith.[3] He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, first as a hobby but he turned professional towards the end of the 1960s.</p>
					<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Baker was part of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre company and had his first big film break in 1971 with the role of Rasputin in the film Nicholas and Alexandra (after Olivier recommended him for the part). He also appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1972 version of Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales as the younger husband of the Wife of Bath.</p>
