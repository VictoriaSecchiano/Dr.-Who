					<p>Hartnell was born in St Pancras, London, England, the only child of Lucy Hartnell, an unmarried mother. He was brought up partly by a foster mother, though he did spend many happy holidays in Devon with his mother's family of farmers, where he learned to ride.</p>
					<p>Hartnell entered the theatre in 1925[2] working under Frank Benson as a general stagehand.[1][4] In 1928 he appeared in the play Miss Elizabeth's Prisoner, by R.N. Stephens and E. Lyall Swete, along with the actress Heather McIntyre. The following year they married.[3] His first of more than sixty film appearances was Say It With Music in 1932.[5] He was cast as 'Albert Fosdike' in NoÃ«l Coward's 1942 film In Which We Serve but turned up late for his first day of shooting. Coward berated Hartnell in front of cast and crew for his unprofessionalism, made him personally apologise to everyone and then sacked him. Michael Anderson, who was the First Assistant Director, took over the part and was credited as "Mickey Anderson".</p>
