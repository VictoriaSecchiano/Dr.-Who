						<p>Tennant was born in Bathgate, West Lothian, Scotland, the son of Essdale Helen (n√©e McLeod) and The Rev. Alexander McDonald (known to family and friends as Sandy McDonald).[4] He grew up with his brother Blair and sister Karen[5] in Ralston, Renfrewshire, where his father was the local Church of Scotland minister.[6][7][8] Tennant's maternal great-grandparents, William and Agnes Blair, were staunch Protestants from Derry in Ulster, the northern province of Ireland, and were among the signatories of the Ulster Covenant in 1912; William was a member of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. Tennant's maternal grandfather, footballer Archie McLeod, met William and Agnes's daughter Nellie while playing for Derry City.[9]</p>
						<p>At the age of three, Tennant told his parents that he wanted to become an actor because he was a fan of Doctor Who,[10] but they tried to encourage him to aim for more conventional work.[5] He watched almost every Doctor Who episode for years, and he spoke to Tom Baker at a book-signing event in Glasgow.[5] Tennant says he was "absurdly single-minded" in pursuing an acting career. Tennant was educated at Ralston Primary and Paisley Grammar School, where he enjoyed a fruitful relationship with English language teacher Moira Robertson, who was among the first to recognise his potential.[11] He acted in school productions throughout primary and secondary school.</p>
